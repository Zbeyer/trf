>   Come now, and **let us reason together**, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

וְנִוָּֽכְחָ֖ה (wə·niw·wā·ḵə·ḥāh)
Conjunctive waw | Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive imperfect Cohortative - first person common plural
[Strong's 3198: ](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_3198.htm)To be right, reciprocal, to argue, to decide, justify, convict

the root 

יָכַח (yakach)

is often translated as *reprove*, *rebuke*, *correct*, or chasten:

>   **[Proverbs 3:12](https://biblehub.com/text/proverbs/3-12.htm)**
>   [HEB:](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/proverbs/3.htm) יֶאֱהַ֣ב יְהוָ֣ה **יוֹכִ֑יחַ** וּ֝כְאָ֗ב אֶת־

>   [KJV:](https://biblehub.com/kjvs/proverbs/3.htm) loveth *he correcteth;* even as a father

So the idea is God—like a loving father—uses reasonable correction to get His children to see things from His perspective. When we **sin**, when we **transgress**, or when we demonstrate **iniquity** God brings us to repentance through this reasonable correction.
