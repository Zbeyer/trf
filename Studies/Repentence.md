Teshuvah (תשובה) is a Hebrew word that translates to "repentance"

> Ezekiel 33:11
> Say to them: 'As I live,' says the Lord GOD, 
> I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, 
> but that the wicked **turn** from his way and live. 
> Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?'
