# Repentence

μετάνοια metanoia

> 2 Peter 3:9
> The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.

שׁוּב 
šûḇ

Teshuvah (תשובה) is a Hebrew word that translates to "repentance"

> Ezekiel 33:11
> Say to them: 'As I live,' says the Lord GOD, 
> I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, 
> but that the wicked **turn** from his way and live. 
> Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?'

```
Change your mind.
Change your actions.
Change your heart.
```

Teshuvah means turn. 
Metanoia means be transformed.

> Ephesians 2:8-9
> For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.

πίστις pistis - faith
Is pursuasion. The grace of God pursudes us to be transformed, to change our behavior. The faith causes repentence.

- Psalm 77:8
> Has His mercy ceased forever? Has His promise failed forevermore?

- Isaiah 30:18
> Therefore the LORD will wait, that He may be gracious to you; And therefore He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; Blessed are all those who wait for Him.

- Romans 2:4
> Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?

- 1 Timothy 2:4
> who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
