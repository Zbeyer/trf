# Discernment & Testing

If someone says to worship other gods, they are a false prophet. 

>   Deuteronomy 13:2 
>
>   And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;

When someone predicts something in the name of God and it doesn't happen, they are a false prophet.

>   Deuteronomy 18:22
>
>   When a prophet **speaketh in the name of the LORD,** if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that *is* the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, *but* the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

The punishment for false prophets in the old testament was being stoned to death. We don't stone false prophets today, but we shouldn't listen to them.
