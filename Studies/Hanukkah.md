# Hanukkah

חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎

> Numbers 7:10
> Now the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.

Ḥănukkā
Meaning: Dedication or rededication

Uses a special menora: instead of the seven candle lamp stand this one uses 9. The central most light is called the Shamash or the attendent. 

שַׁמָּשׁ

It gives light to the others.

The holiday commemorates the recapture of jerusalem in 164 BC.

There is a legend that there was a miraculous consumption of oil (the claim is there was only one day of oil, but the oil burned for the full eight to dedicate a new alter). This miracle is has no additional sources, maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. The real miracle is a rag tag gollia army of hebrews retook the temple from the greeks in the first place.

The burning of the lamps for eight days is a commemoration of the eight days of dedication to set up a new alter.
