# Jonah


## Introduction 

Jonah starts in the book of 2nd kings:

> 2 Kings 14:25
He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant **Jonah the son of Amittai**, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.

Jona (יוֹנָה) means dove, so he might have been mentioned by Hosea since they were Contemporary

> Hosea 11:11
They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt,
Like a dove from the land of Assyria.
And I will let them dwell in their houses,"
Says the LORD.

Nineveh was the capitol city of Assyria. As such, it was used often as a stand in for all of Assyria. In the same way Washington (DC) is used in historical documents to represent the politics of the USA or Moscow the USSR.

So the book of Nahum begins with, "The burden against Nineveh," but can be an endemic against the entire Assyrian empire.

Because Jonah was from the northern kingdom and was a prophet to Jeroboam II, and we have a brief history that he made prophetic statements in 2nd Kings, we can surmise he was a prophet during the great affluence and spirtual decline of the north. Though the short book of the prophet focuses us on his call, rejection, and reluctant ministry in Nineveh, he had a long and storied minustry outside his book. It is very probable he argued dydactively against the northern Kingdom's actions. We are told in 2 Kings 14:24 that Jeroboam did evil in the sight of the Lord.

Gath or winepress was probly in or near Galilee. Thus Jonah and Jesus were from the Galilee area. 

> John 7:52
They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."

The Pharisees forgot about Jonah. 

## Context

The Assyrian empire had a reputation of being not nice. They invented an early form of crusefixtion. It was the last place a Jewish prophet wanted to go—it was likely a death sentence. 

At the time the Assyrians of Nineveh worshiped Dagon, a fish god. Thus when Jonah was vomited up by a fish the Dagon worshipers would have seen that as a sign that this was a man from their god.

## Jonah 1

## Jonah 2
