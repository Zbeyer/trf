# Jonah

Jonah starts in the book of 2nd kings:

> 2 Kings 14:25
He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant **Jonah the son of Amittai**, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.

Jona (יוֹנָה) means dove, so he might have been mentioned by Hosea since they were Contemporary

> Hosea 11:11
They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt,
Like a dove from the land of Assyria.
And I will let them dwell in their houses,"
Says the LORD.

Nineveh was the capitol city of Assyria. As such, it was used often as a stand in for all of Assyria. In the same way Washington (DC) is used in historical documents to represent the politics of the USA or Moscow the USSR.

So the book of Nahum begins with, "The burden against Nineveh," but can be an endemic against the entire Assyrian empire.
