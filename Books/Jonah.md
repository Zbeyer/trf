# Jonah


## Introduction 

Jonah starts in the book of 2nd kings:

> 2 Kings 14:25
He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant **Jonah the son of Amittai**, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.

Jona (יוֹנָה) means dove, so he might have been mentioned by Hosea since they were Contemporary

> Hosea 11:11
They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt,
Like a dove from the land of Assyria.
And I will let them dwell in their houses,"
Says the LORD.

Nineveh was the capitol city of Assyria. As such, it was used often as a stand in for all of Assyria. In the same way Washington (DC) is used in historical documents to represent the politics of the USA or Moscow the USSR.

So the book of Nahum begins with, "The burden against Nineveh," but can be an endemic against the entire Assyrian empire.

Because Jonah was from the northern kingdom and was a prophet to Jeroboam II, and we have a brief history that he made prophetic statements in 2nd Kings, we can surmise he was a prophet during the great affluence and spirtual decline of the north. Though the short book of the prophet focuses us on his call, rejection, and reluctant ministry in Nineveh, he had a long and storied minustry outside his book. It is very probable he argued dydactively against the northern Kingdom's actions. We are told in 2 Kings 14:24 that Jeroboam did evil in the sight of the Lord.

Gath or winepress was probly in or near Galilee. Thus Jonah and Jesus were from the Galilee area. 

> John 7:52
They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."

The Pharisees forgot about Jonah. 

## Context

The Assyrian empire had a reputation of being not nice. They invented an early form of crusefixtion. It was the last place a Jewish prophet wanted to go—it was likely a death sentence. 

At the time the Assyrians of Nineveh worshiped Dagon, a fish god. Thus when Jonah was vomited up by a fish the Dagon worshipers would have seen that as a sign that this was a man from their god.

_If God said get up and go to Hamas, or Hesbolah, or the CCP would you go?_

If Jonah went one of two things would happen: either he'd be killed by the assyrians in a brutal and public way or God would have mercy on them. Jonah was watching his own countrymen turn from God, there was a reason to want to stay and preach where he was. Jonah wanted to preach repentence where he was at. Not in some foreign land. Certainly not in Assyria.

## Jonah 1
Jonah is called, and rejects the call.

> 1 The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai:
> 2 “Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.”
> 
> 3 But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
> 
> 4 Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up. 5 All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
> 
> But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. 6 The captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.”
> 
> 7 Then the sailors said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. 8 So they asked him, “Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”
> 
> 9 He answered, “I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
> 
> 10 This terrified them and they asked, “What have you done?” (They knew he was running away from the Lord, because he had already told them so.)
> 
> 11 The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?”
> 
> 12 “Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he replied, “and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.”
> 
> 13 Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. 14 Then they cried out to the Lord, “Please, Lord, do not let us die for taking this man’s life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, Lord, have done as you pleased.” 15 Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. 16 At this the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
>
> 17 Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

## Jonah 2
Jonah prays from the belly of the fish.

דָּאג ḏâg̱ 

was probably a fish, may have been a whale (the same word was used for both back in the day), the word is not

 לִוְיָתָן liwyâṯân 
the sea serpant called leviathan. 


The people who favor the whale interpretation think Jonah survived for three days and three nights in the stomach of the beast, those who prefer the fish interpretation say Jonah died and was resurrected. We dont know which of these is correct.

## Jonah 3
Jonah is called again, and answers the call.

The preaching of predictive prophesy usually comes also with the idea that שׁוּב šûḇ — repentance (teshuvah) can delay or forstall judgement. 

So the message, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown," carries the implication that God will relent if the people repent. Jonah—knowing this—did not want Nineveh to hear the message. This is why certain Calvary teachers have said Jonah had murderous intent.

## Jonah 4
Jonah argues with God.
