# Jonah

Jonah starts in the book of 2nd kings:

> 2 Kings 14:25
He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant **Jonah the son of Amittai**, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.
